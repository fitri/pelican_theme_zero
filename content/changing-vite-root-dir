By default running Vite from npm command ```npm run dev``, current dir will be as root to serve the application.

There's cases where the current dir was not the root or where the index file live, for example this dir structure where npm init package was the main project dir and the src was the deployment folder.

```bash
project_dir
    package.json
    vite.config.js
        src/
            index.html
```
For this cases, to change the default serving root dir we can explicitly specify the root dir inside ```vite.config.js```.

If the file didn't existed, created it and define the root dir.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  root: './src/', 
});
```

The path was relative to the ```package.json``` which wrapping the vite command with npm run command.

```json
{
  "name": "vite",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
    "postcss": "^8.4.24",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.2",
    "vite": "^4.3.9"
  }
}
```
